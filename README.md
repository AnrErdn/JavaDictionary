# 📚 Java Dictionary App

The **Java Dictionary App** is a console-based dictionary application built entirely using core Java. It allows users to store, search, edit, and delete word definitions in a clean and organized interface. This project is built with the goal of mastering core Java concepts, object-oriented programming, clean code architecture, and data handling.

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Build a dictionary without using any front-end UI frameworks
- Practice **OOP principles** such as encapsulation, abstraction, and inheritance
- Work with **Java Collections** like HashMap for efficient data storage
- Use **file handling** to save and load dictionary data persistently
- Create a strong Java back-end foundation to eventually connect with a front-end

- [x] Add new words with definitions  
- [x] View all words and definitions  
- [x] Search for a word

## 🧠 What I'm Learning

This project helps reinforce:

- Java syntax and structure
- OOP (classes, objects, methods, encapsulation)
- Data structures like HashMap
- File I/O (FileReader, FileWriter)
- Clean folder organization for scalable apps
- How to eventually build a back-end for web apps

---

## 💡 Future Plans

- Build a simple front-end (web or GUI) to interact with the dictionary
- Turn this into a REST API using Spring Boot or Java Servlets
- Allow multiple language support (English, Mongolian, etc.)
- Add synonym/antonym support
- Include part-of-speech tags

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Java 17+
- No frameworks (vanilla Java)
- Text files for data persistence
- Terminal/console-based UI
